			<h2> Licensed Childcare facilities in New Jersey post Covid-19</h2>
			<h4> Post Covid-19 Pandemic, childcare facilites have changed. <br>By Madeline Marino</h4>

			<p>Buisnessess have reopened but people remian hesitant. Child care centers have reopened but parents recognize there is only so much employees can do when stopping the spread of germs from toddlers and infants. From drooling to sharing toys and not washing hands, it is hard to monitor this sickness from spreading.

			<h3>The Covid effect</h3>
			<p> Many parents have come up with their own reasons as to why they are no longer sending their child to childcare facilities. Parents lost employment and no longer needed childcare, some state and local officals ordered facilities to shut down temporarily. It was difficult for young children to wear masks, making it difficult for proivders to keep up with every child. In a breifing from the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, Office of Human Services Policy, the costs of opperating became increasingly expensive to remain open. As fewer children enrolled, earnings decreased. These challenging times reflected in the employees, depression and anixety rates skyrocketed. Majority of employees are women. When child care centers closed many women reduced their level of employment to care for their children.

			<p>Another effect of the pandemic has been the lack of employees at childcare centers. 

				In a January 2023 briefing, The Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, Office of Human Services Policy released a breifing from 2020-2022 about the Child Care Industry trends during the recovery from the pandemic.  

				As of November 2022, employment in child care facilities have still not yet returned to the pre-pandemic levels. The number of programs have increased but the amount of employees overall in this category have decreased. 

				To adjust to this, inflation and the post-pandemic prices, the salary earnings have increased. But this is still not enough as an incentive for workers to reeturn post-pandemic. </p>

			<h3>Financially, is this affordable?</h3>
			<p> Parents working from home may need that relief from monitioring their children, but is that affordable now? Covid-19 has made it difficult to afford childcare services. A rise in job losses and work hours have been reduced, child care centers can be too expensive for parents to afford now. The influence job incsecuirty can have on families may cause them to reevaluate thier spendning and cut out on childcare facilities. If a parent was cut from their job they may no longer have the need for childcare facilities.

			<h3>What school administrations did</h3>
			<p>William H. Ross School Principal, Bernadette Todd, tells how her school handled the pandemic.  The school educates grades preschool through fourth grade.  Although this is a public school, there are only 197 students total. They are in the top 30% of all schools in New Jersey based on overall test scores. Their student to teacher ratio is 7:1, this is lower than the New Jersey state average 11:1. 
<div class="list">
				<ul>
					<li>Contact tracing: If one student tested positive for Covid-19 the administration would track who came into contact with them before the positive test result.</li>
					<li>Masks, Hand santizing: Standard practice we have seen from the pandemic in mostly all schools in the state.  Masks being worn by anyone in the school building and the implementation of more hand santiziing stations throughout the school.</li>
					<li>Classes smaller in size: When classes were able to be reduced in size they were. Multiple sections were created to supplement this.</li>
					<li>Spaced children apart: Within the classrooms children were spaced apart, three to six feet.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
				<p> Academic classes were held in the morning hours and children would go home at lunch and continue with classes such as art and gym class, called â€œspecials'' virtually.  Trying to preserve school as normal as possible for young children was important to the school. 
				</p> 
			
		<p>Post-pandemic parents are hesitant and unable to afford additional childcare support.  Many are worried about the cleanliness of the locations. They feel total transparency may not have been there during the pandemic. Employees are not being paid enough for the challenging work they are doing entertaining children while maintaining a healthy environment. Employess are not being paid enough for them to care enough. Parents often worry there is more of a risk for young children to contract the virus and spread it to immunocompromised family members. Espically grandparents. Post-pandemic, parents are doing what they feel is best for their families to stay safe during unprecedented times.
